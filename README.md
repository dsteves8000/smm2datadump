Every single Maker ID and Course ID out there plus some future ones that haven't been assigned to to-be-new players or courses yet (each text file contains one million IDs), includes IDs that also have been for deleted courses. 
  
For Course IDs as they are sorted in chronological order when the course was submitted you can find the file that has the course ID you are looking for by searching for the file by date. For example, all courses in the 3,xxx,xxxth index are between 6/27/19 and 7/2/19:

Maker IDs are also in chronological order of when the ID became registered to a user but it is less obvious to find out where a user is other than guessing.
  
While Maker IDs start at index 1, for some reason course IDs start in the 3,000,000s.  
  
Included is also a Java program that can be used to quickly convert back and forth between an in-game ID and actual index.
